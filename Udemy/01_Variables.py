# In Python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).

age = 34 # integer
name = "Ashish" # string
cgpa = 4.55 # float

# Rule of defining a variable in Python  
# Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
